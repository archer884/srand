# srand
Server-random.

The idea here is that you have a service running in the background that provides you with random numbers. This way you don't need to worry about reinitializing the darn thing every time you want another number, and it can keep its state straight. I was thinking this might make it more likely to get a proper distribution? I dunno. Whatever.

You and I both know that this whole problem space is a flimsy excuse to build a web service.
